## Challenges
- Tight timeline - The hackathon format meant all development had to be completed very quickly, which limited the overall scope and resulted in taking some shortcuts.
- Scope creep - Adding too many features resulted in some half-finished functionality rather than polished core features. Better scoping would have helped.
- Feature creep - Ideas for new features kept getting added late into development, stretching our resources.
